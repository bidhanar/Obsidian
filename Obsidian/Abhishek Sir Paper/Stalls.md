#Static_stall is what we typically think of, when we think of stall. Slowly increasing AOA and then loss of lift as the flow separates.

But pitch rate (rate of increase of AOA) has an impact too. At high pitch rates, the wing can go beyond normal stall AOA and still provide significant lift, but for just a short period of time. After that, the bottom falls out. This is #dynamic_stall.
