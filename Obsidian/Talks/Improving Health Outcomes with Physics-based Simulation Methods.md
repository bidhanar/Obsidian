### Abstract
Digital transformation continues to pervade every industry - automotive, aerospace, electronics, logistics, and manufacturing, to name a few. The impact of these advances in modeling and simulation technologies and their applications is also being felt in biomedical engineering, medicine, and healthcare. The first part of this presentation will provide an overview of the underpinnings of physics-based simulation software, while touching on current practices and emerging trends in areas such as Numerical Methods, High-Performance Computing, and Machine Learning. The second part of the talk will focus on new initiatives and applications in healthcare with a focus on a few areas such as cardiology. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide with coronary artery disease being a major burden on healthcare systems. Over the past decade researchers and practitioners have developed modeling and simulation decision-making tools and examples of these in the clinical workflow will be shared. Speaker will also discuss the future direction of modeling and simulation in the fields of biomedical engineering, medicine, and healthcare.

### Presentation
- Ansys is a simulation focused software company, providing products for physics of structures, fluids , electronics, etc.
- #digital_twin is a simulated model of a system which is maintained at the same state as the system to visualize the current condition of the system.
#### Machine Learning and Engineering Solution
- There are two types of methods to use the ML model.
- **Bottom up** methods include accelerating existing solvers or making new solvers.
- **Top-down** methods include optimization and calibration, #digital_twin.

#### Turbulent model tuning with AI-ML
- Toolset from Ansys improves the accuracy of the GEKO model for turbulence in specific classes of problems. 

#### GPU
- GPUs are designed to do one simple task very efficiently.
- CPU performance improves approximately 1.1x times per year, whereas GPU performance increases by a factor of 1.5x times.

#### Healthcare
- There are a few challenges in healthcare:
	1. Skyrocketing Cost
	2. Decline in number of Healthcare workers
	3. Reduce animal and human testing
	4. Outcome based medicine : Predictive medicine at personal and population scale.
	5. Shift to care outside the hospital
#### Impact of physics based methods in healthcare
- Bio-pharma has uses as follows:
	1. Drug discovery using computational biology
	2. Drug development
	3. Drug Manufacturing
	4. Drug Delivery
- Medical devices has uses as follows:
	1. Help doctors see the body models
	2. Create body #digital_twin 
* In case of intake of medicine and drugs, simulation can help vastly.
* There is a requirement of huge data for ML models, but in the absence of this data, Physics based models are very helpful.
- The medical device manufactures only get a small percentage (10 %) from their devices.
- Simulation allows for amplification of data.
- Gartner predicted that by 2030 most of the data used for AI models will be synthetic.

#### Cardiovascular simulations
Following uses are coming up related to cardiovascular system:
- Pacemaker
- Artificial hearts
- Electro-mechanical heart modeling
- Stent modeling
