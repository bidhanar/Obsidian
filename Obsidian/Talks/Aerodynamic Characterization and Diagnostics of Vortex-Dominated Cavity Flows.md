## Abstract
 The presentation will provide an overview of research activities at FCAAP and discuss a few results on vortex-dominated and cavity flows. A slender body of revolution experiences large side forces and yaw moments due to flow asymmetry at high angles of attack. The flow asymmetry is characterized by asymmetric vortices that form near the nose region, interact with the surfaces downstream, and produce a large side force. The main objectives of our study are to improve the fundamental understanding of vortex-dominated flows and the nature of forebody vortices and their interactions. Another complex flow field encountered in current tactical aircraft arises during store separation from an internal weapons bay. When bay doors are opened during store release, a shear layer is formed between the high-speed freestream flow and the low-speed flow inside the cavity. The shear layer effectively spans the cavity length and width and is susceptible to different forms of two-dimensional and three-dimensional instabilities. The result is a highly turbulent flow and an intense aero acoustic environment in and around the bay.
 
## Presentation
* The pressure maps can be constructed using PCP by using cameras from all sides in the optical access enabled wind tunnel.
* Polysonic wind tunnel includes a PIV(Particle Image Velocimetry) camera.
* Laser Camera with a frequency of 15KHz is used to scan for images, which takes 200 images in 60 seconds.
Following includes the notes on the topic of Vortex Asymmetry:
* Different types of cylinders were explored having different shapes and some with fins. 
* "Phantom Yaw Problem" is a problem of yaw for which the reason is not known.
* Increasing AoA in a cylinder to $15^0$ makes the vortex asymmetric. Increasing the AoA further makes the flow like a cross flow.
* The asymmetry starts at 2$\theta_c$ ,where $\theta_c$ is the half-cone angle.
* One of the vortex is lifted up and other sticks to the body creating a large pressure difference. This is mostly due to imperfections, because the CFD models did not show this asymmetry. 
* This asymmetry even switches side. 
* This asymmetry depends on Re too. In the transitional regime the side force due to this asymmetry is tricky and can be large or small. 
* This flow experiment was done for low speed flows. 
* In simulations, if a perturbation is introduced, the asymmetry is seen, but the magnitude is not similar because of infeasibility of being able to model the imperfections. 
* In controlled surface imperfections on the nose, the imperfections being of the order of boundary layer thickness, the asymmetry can be controlled. 
* %%The asymmetry is only influenced by the imperfections of the nose.%% 
* Secondary shear layer vortices pull the primary vortices and retains its strength.

### Cylinder with Fins
* Due to interaction of vortices with the fins, we get roll moments along with yaw moments due to asymmetry.
* Forebody Articulation provides many opportunity, the nose of the cylinder can be articulated in different directions to counter the moments. 
* Articulation can be achieved using two motors near the nose of the cylinder. 
* There are many different trajectories when the missiles are dropped from the bottom bay area of the aircraft.  

### Dynamic door opening
When the door opens, there is a cavity flow. 
* An airplane door opens in 1.5 sec, and to simulate that, the experiment door must be opened in 50ms.
* As soon as you open, there is a large pressure pulse. The systems inside experience a large pressure. 
* In the cavity a captive trajectory system was used with 6-D force and moment balance.
* Also the gravity abled drop were to be tested. 
* A very small change in release conditions can change the trajectory of the missile. If it drops with a nose up attitude, it can go and hit the parent aircraft.
* When the missile is ejected, due to cavity there is resonance in the components inside the cavity, resulting in oscillation of the missile.
